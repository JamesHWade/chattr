import the counties csv file

 
```{r}
counties <- read.csv("data/county-hospital.csv")
```
 
Summarize the data 

```{r}
summary(counties)
```

Calculate the mean of the population column 

```{r}
mean(counties$Population)
```

create a plot comparing the number of hospitals and population

 in each county 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(counties, aes(x = Population, y = Hospitals)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Population", y = "Hospitals")
```

create a model the predicts the number of hospitals based on population

 
 
```{r}
# create a linear model
model <- lm(Hospitals ~ Population, data = counties)

# print the model
model

# plot the model
ggplot(counties, aes(x = Population, y = Hospitals)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Population", y = "Hospitals")
```






































```{r}
tc_defaults()$model
```
